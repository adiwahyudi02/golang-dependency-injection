# golang-dependency-injection

This repository contains examples and practical demonstrations of implementing Dependency Injection (DI) in Go using [**`google/wire`**](https://github.com/google/wire).

The project is intended as a learning reference for understanding how DI works in Go applications â€” why it is useful, and how to apply it in different scenarios such as constructor injection, struct providers, interface bindings, provider sets, and error handling.

Each example is written as a small, focused case or test to demonstrate a specific DI feature, best practice, or common pitfall when working with Google Wire.
